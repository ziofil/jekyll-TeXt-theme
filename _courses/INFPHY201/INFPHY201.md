title: Quantum Mechanics in python

instructors:
  - Filippo Miatto
  - Fréderic Grosshans

announcements:
  - The course will begin in May
  - Co-taught with Frederic Grosshans

short_description: An exploratory introduction to quantum mehcanics through python and jupyter notebooks.

description: | 
  In this course you will learn to describe quantum systems and to compute how they evolve and interact with each other, by modelling them in Python.

  Throughout the course you will develop a project, which will be published on the home page of the course. Projects consist in developing a jupyter notebook aimed at explaining a concept or exploring a particular effect.
  
  We will adopt a peer-review system, where you will submit your notebook by the end of the 6th week. Each of you will receive two projects to review in a week's time. The projects and the feedback will be returned to the authors, who will have one final week to implement the recommended changes before finally submitting for publication.


course_goals:
  - describe quantum states and interactions in code (Python)
  - compute the evolution of quantum states
  - display representations of quantum states
  - express a technical narrative using jupyter notebooks
  - give and receive feedback in a peer-review loop

## How to advance through the course
This is a 7 weeks long (8 lectures), project-based course. At the end of the course the projects will be published on the website of the course (it's not the one your are in). Each week we will have two consecutive 90 minutes lectures (hopefully this will improve in the future).

You will be evaluated on your effort, on the quality of your project and on the feedback that you will give to other projects. You will work individually or in groups toward a project in the form of a jupyter notebook. The topic of the project will be chosen by you, after an initial week of selection (skimming papers). It can fall under the categories of visualizations, simulations or lectures.

At the end of **week 5** you must submit the candidate final project (not just a draft, but something you would actually publish online). At the beginning of **week 6** you will be assigned two (anonymized) projects that you have to __review and resubmit__ by the end of the week. The reviews will be evaluated and they will contribute your final score. You will be given instructions on how to review.

On **week 7**, you will receive the reviews back, and you will have until the end of the week to submit the final version. The final versions will be presented during the final lecture, and they will be published on the course's website.
