In this post we'll see how to obtain a numerical array representation of a CV quantum channel using [Strawberry Fields](https://strawberryfields.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and tangentially, the [Choi-Jamiolkowsky isomorphism](http://mattleifer.info/2011/08/01/the-choi-jamiolkowski-isomorphism-youre-doing-it-wrong/).

We begin by importing a few things
```python
import strawberryfields as sf
from strawberryfields import ops
import numpy as np
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt

# Introduction
I find that it is often really helpful to think about linear algebra in terms of tensor indices. We can think of a scalar as a vector with no indices, of a vector as a tensor with one index, of a matrix as a tensor with two indices and so on. Multiplications of these objects are achieved by "contracting" the indices, e.g. $$\sum_j A_{ij}x_j$$ is the contraction of the second index of $$A$$ and the first (and only) of $$x$$, which corresponds to the matrix-vector product between the matrix $$A$$ and the vector $$x$$. I'm going to rely a lot on indices in the rest of this post, but I'll be still talking about stuff that a student of quantum mechanics should be familiar with (state vectors, unitary matrices and so forth).

::: warning
WARNING: I will omit the summation symbol and adopt the convention that _repeated indices are summed over_, like so: `$\sum_j A_{ij}x_j \rightarrow A_{ij}x_j$`.

# Primer on graphical calculus
Graphical calculus is a visual language for tensor algebra. Many algebraic manipulations of matrices and tensors can be described and combined through simple diagrams. There are two principles: each wire is an index, connecting wires means contracting the indices. 

In quantum mechanics, a unitary matrix evolves the state vector through a matrix product, and therefore an index contraction. A partial trace contracts two indices of the same tensor, and a tensor product just stacks the new indices.

# Unitary Channels

## single-mode: squeezing and displacement
We will first look at the simple case where the channel is just a unitary transformation, as in 
`$\phi_i = U_{ij}\psi_j$`, in which case we just want to obtain the unitary matrix `$U$`.

First, we will need another copy of the mode `A` where the vector $\psi_j$ lives (and on which $U$ operates). In Strawberry Fields, this means generating an engine object that has 2 subsystems, which we call `A` and `B`:


```python
engine, (A, B) = sf.Engine(num_subsystems=2)
dim = 20 # dimension that we will use for our Hilbert spaces
```

Now we exploit the fact that $$U_{ij}I_{jk} = U_{ik}$$ (where $I$ is the identity matrix) to obtain $U$. We just have to tell the engine to operate with $U$ on one of the two indices of $I$. That's the reason why we need two copies of $\mathcal{H}$, we are going to use one per index:


```python
I = np.identity(dim)
with engine:
    ops.Ket(I) | (A, B)
```

What happened here is that we have forced the engine to interpret the identity matrix as the collection of amplitudes of a state on _two_ modes. As the identity matrix contains 1's on the diagonal, the state that it defines has amplitude 1 when the basis elements in the two spaces are the same and zero otherwise: 
$$I_{ij} \simeq \sum_{i,j=1}^\mathrm{dim} I_{ij}|i,j\rangle = \sum_{i=1}^\mathrm{dim} |i,i\rangle$$
(which incidentally is the unnormalized Bell state $$|\phi^+\rangle$$).

Applying the unitary to one of the two subsystems is therefore equivalent to multiplying it by the identity matrix $U_{ij}I_{jk}$: the result will be $U_{ik}$. For example, let's extract the unitary of a Squeezing gate:


```python
# continued from above
with engine:
    ops.Sgate(1.5) | A

U = engine.run('fock', cutoff_dim=dim, eval=False).ket()
```

Let's plot the absolute value of its entries. You'll notice the typical "checkerboard pattern" that is associated with squeezing number states:


```python
plt.matshow(np.abs(U));
```

Here's an analogous example with the displacement operator:


```python
engine, (A, B) = sf.Engine(num_subsystems=2)
dim = 20
I = np.identity(dim)

with engine:
    ops.Ket(I) | (A, B)
    ops.Dgate(1.5) | A
    
U = engine.run('fock', cutoff_dim=dim, eval=False).ket()
plt.matshow(np.real(U));
```

## multi-mode: beamsplitter
Obviously, this works also when the unitary that we want to obtain already operates on more than a single Hilbert space. In this case, we just need to double or triple what we did for a single space.

Here we demonstrate the Hong-Ou-Mandel effect in an unusual way, i.e. only by looking at the unitary of the beamsplitter.

We first extract the unitary of a beamsplitter, up to dimensiom 3 (i.e. for states of up to 2 photons). This is a unitary that acts on two spaces, and therefore it has 4 indices: the first pair are output-input indices on the first mode and the second pair are output-input indices on the second mode.


```python
engine, (A, B, C, D) = sf.Engine(num_subsystems=4)

dim = 3
I = np.identity(dim)
II = np.einsum('ab,cd',I,I) # outer product I_{ab}I_{cd} 

with engine:
    ops.Ket(II) | (A, B, C, D)
    ops.BSgate(np.pi/4) | (A, C) # 50/50 beamsplitter

U = engine.run('fock', cutoff_dim=dim, eval=False).ket()
```

Here we have computed $U_{ia,kc}I_{ab}I_{cd} = U_{ib,kd}$, where $i$ and $k$ are the output indices of the beamsplitter transformation. So let's introduce a single photon via the _input_ indices $b$ and $d$:


```python
np.abs(U[:,1,:,1])**2
```


    array([[0.     , 0.     , 0.5],
           [0.     , 0.     , 0. ],
           [0.5    , 0.     , 0. ]])



We can see that the only nonzero probabilities correspond to 
the output states $$|0,2\rangle$$ and $$|2,0\rangle$$, which means that the photons always exit randomly, but in the same mode (i.e. from the same port of the beamsplitter).

# Non-unitary Channels
If the channel is not unitary, its description is not going to be in terms of a simple matrix. The reason is that earlier, the state transformation $U$ was a map from $\mathcal{H}$ to $\mathcal{H}$, because $U$ acted directly on state _vectors_. Now we have a transformation that acts on state _matrices_ and is therefore a map from $\mathcal{B}(\mathcal{H})$ to $\mathcal{B}(\mathcal{H})$ ($\mathcal{B}(\mathcal{H})$ is the space of bounded operators on $\mathcal{H}$). This means that now we will populate our two modes with matrices instead of vectors (and therefore each mode really correspond to 2 copies of a Hilbert space).


```python
engine, (A, B) = sf.Engine(num_subsystems=2)
dim = 3
```

We now need to pick a channel representation and then extract it with another CJ trick. Let's see how to obtain the Choi operator. The way a channel operates on a density matrix $$\rho_{ij}$$ can be expressed with a set of Kraus operators $A_{ij,k}$. Each Kraus operator is a matrix and we index all of them through the index $k$, hence the comma to stress the difference between the indices. The way we use them is by sandwiching the input density matrix and summing over all sandwiches (which are indexed by $k$): $$\rho_{im}^\mathrm{after} = A_{ij,k}\rho_{jl}A_{ml,k}^*$$ Notice that I have swapped $m$ and $l$ in the Kraus operator on the right, as we should use the conjugate _transposed_ operator on the right.

The Choi operator is essentially the Kraus sandwich without the ham (and with the indices in this precise order): $$J_{jlim} = A_{ij,k}\ A_{ml,k}^*$$. Using $J$ or using the Kraus sandwich is exactly equivalent, but there is an advantage in using $J$, and it is that it looks like a "vector"-"matrix" multiplication: $$\rho_{im}^\mathrm{after} = \rho_{jl}J_{jlim}$$. Notice that the indices of $\rho$ seem swapped with respect to those of $J$ (if we were to carry out a regular matrix product), and that's the reason why in the usual formula of the Choi representation of a channel there is a transpose: $$\rho_B^\mathrm{after} = \mathrm{Tr}_A[(\rho^T_A\otimes I_B)J_{AB}]$$.

## single-mode: lossy bosonic channel
Here we reproduce in code what we presented above:

```python
# notice the order of the indices
I = np.einsum('ab,cd->acbd',np.identity(dim),np.identity(dim))

with engine:
    ops.DensityMatrix(I) | (A, B)
    ops.LossChannel(0.9) | A # 10% lossy channel

J = engine.run('fock', cutoff_dim=dim, eval=False).dm()
```


```python
L = np.einsum('abcd->dbca', J) # Liouville operator
```
