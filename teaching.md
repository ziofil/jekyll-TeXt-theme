### Learning Goals

## [ACCQ206](/teaching/ACCQ206/ACCQ206.html)
A course on the basics of quantum computation and quantum communications, with an overview on the state of the art of reserch and applications.
### Learning Goals
- describe and apply various quantum algorithms 
- explain the principles of quantum error correction
- distinguish the types of quantum repeaters
- compute the secret key rate of a few quantum key distribution protocols

## [INFPHY201](/teaching/INFPHY201/INFPHY201.html)
An exploratory introduction to quantum mehcanics through python and jupyter notebooks.
### Learning Goals
- represent quantum states through numerical arrays
- operate on quantum states with quantum channels 
- evolve a quantum system under various conditions and constraints
- compute various properties of a quantum system and display them in the appropriate way
- express a technical narrative clearly, using jupyter notebooks
- give and receive feedback in a peer-review loop

## [QENG301](/teaching/QEng/QEng301.html)
